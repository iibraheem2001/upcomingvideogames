                    Starting out in a seemingly emptied-out world, an astronaut returns to find a little girl and a holographic cat. That's when things take a turn for the weird, as it's all revealed to be a simulation set in space. Pragmata is coming in 2022 to PlayStation 5. It's also going to release on PC and Xbox Series X.
